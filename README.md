Myself Manikandan done my BE(EEE) from bharath engineering College at 2013, After my graduation i started my career in

Kryptos Technologies has a Trainee Monitoring i was worked with a L2 engineers a assign complex requests. I was worked with monitoring, generating reports like a servers, CPU, Memory and utilizations from linux servers using top, df, free, uptime ina adaily and weekly basis sent to the clients.

I got a experiance in a cognizant technology i started work has in a ITIL processing, Ticketing basis i give a support. I got a experiance in linux servers like FTP, NFS, SAMBA,configurations and used ina hands on experiance , user administration, i saw a complex issues like kernal panic issue, cpu load, storage issues.  I have a work experience in RHEL 6, 7 and CentOS, Oracle Linux, Ubuntu flavours, installations and configurations. I have completed RHCSA certificate at 2018. well know with the file systems partions manually and well know know with the file system hyraricy like /, /boot, /bin, /sbin,

My previous experiance build and release team with azure cloud environment where linux servers are hosted.  1) we do a VM build using Jarvis automation tool. we will get the required inputs from the client using the build template and will do the build using this tool once build is done we will perform the post validations on the server.  2) OS patching, on a quartely basis whenever new release in redhat announced.  3) BAU activities like incident handling, ticket managment, defect management.  4) Co-ordinated end to end in all CRQ implementatations.  5) SOP document preparation on regular BAU Activiteis.    I have resolving customer issues via the telephone, emails, slack messengers (or) Zoom meeting session.  Regular followups with customers with recommendations and updates.

I got a opportunity ina verizon technologies as a Application Support engineer.  we are supporting application called reveal for both US and Europe customers which  helps in tracking vehicle, pulling and analyse of datas.  whatevers activities taking place in the application we will be responsible for it.  whatever may be the issue we need to validate the alerts, quicj response to the issues following up end to end till it get resolved.  We normally use differenct kinds of tools for the monirtoring purpose for this application we have 4 to 5 monitoring tools like new relic, pingdom, rabbitmq, appdynamics. Here all the ,omitoring tools are integraterate into the slack channels and additional monitoring also called checkmk background with the nagios related application all the alerts notifies int he slack channel and activities related CAB related acctiviteis also be notoified in the slack channel.  If any issues or anything went wrong in the application we will get notification on this slack channel and we need to respond the alert immediatley and needs to check the whether ts false alert or valid alert and need to be informed in the channel if the alert is valid then we need to identitify then with the some inatial troubleshooting steps and analysing customer facing issues and impacts as wll by needs to coordinate with the relavent team and rectify the organizing a war room we will be creating an incident SMAX to track the issues.   Has well we are supporting has salesforce tickets its customer service realted we asare managing customer accoutns tracking GPS data, fuel card services, garmin and live map  any notifications related customer escalates to the monitoring team we are support also a saleforce tickets any features enable, adons  and any need to customer process oriented we have support or else beyond the process, nay changes bug related we will raise a jira.

patching process:  we had BMC Remediation tool and through the tool pushed the patched for all the production servers and for non production servers we had local repor configures so with that local repo first we will ensure that first we will take snapshots, we get a CAB call we will raise a CRQ.

Devops Interviw
===========================


Hi I’m Manikandan Kannappan over all I having around 7 years of experience. Currently
working in CGI as a SSE and also, I’m
using AWS services in my project.
Like in AWS I have good hands on experience on 18+services.
We are Managing 4 environment like Development, QA, UAT, and Production Environment.

Role:
So, my roles will be like based on application stack,
Therefore, based upon the development team and client team requirement, I will be setting up
all the services on all different environments.
As I mentioned Development, QA and UAT as I said we had couple of DevOps tools used on
our Project like GIT, Jenkins, Docker, Ansible

And also, I have good knowledge on writing terraform scripts and then using Kubernetes, it’s
EKS services in AWS , So, we have recently Implemented EKS on our project
This are my keys I can say.

And

When I coming to the day to day activity like we using servicenow ticketing tool my
developer and the client team will raise the incident so based up on that I need to work on
different environments
And also, I will be writing CICD pipelines, actually so in the CICD we have used scripted
pipeline that is complete in groovy script.
I have good hands on creating a groovy script
So, my script contains almost 7 stages.
Initially what I will do that setting up all the servers and then I will be doing the integration
activity following that I will be writing the pipeline
so, this is the DevOps part
Setting up servers Do integration activity Write pipeline
, when coming to the AWS as I already say it’s based upon application stack, so we using different type of services actually,
We used java--based application here and we have both on-premises as well as cloud-premises.based application here
So far, we are now complete in the cloud actually, so we have separate team for onnow completed in the cloud actually, so we have separate team for on--promises.
As I am being part of the cloud team, I will be using all cloud services
These are my role
When I’m coming to the project, recently we are working for the project hutch,So they are based on US
So, the business is completely a Telecom sector,  US based project,  and they are doing business in the cloud so they recommended AWS cloud and some clients are doing business in azure as well as, in future business We are planning to move to azure also.
So, this actually my things in current project. 


I can say so both I have a good hands--on in AWS and also DevOps,
